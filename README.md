## Results and Analysis

I carefully monitored the training progress over 15 epochs, ensuring optimal performance without overfitting. Below is the conclusion of training:

- **VAL Loss:** 0.2678
- **Val ROC-AUC:** 0.805
- **Validation Accuracy:** 73.56%
- **Test Loss:** 0.5398
- **Test ROC-AUC:** 0.8044
- **Test Accuracy:** 73.46%

Below are the Loss, accuracy, and ROC-AUC curves for the architectures, illustrating the point of overfitting and the epoch at which the models were saved.
